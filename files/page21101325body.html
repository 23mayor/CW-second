FORCE MAJEURE <br /><br /> Neither party shall be held liable or responsible to the other party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any obligation under this Agreement when such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, including but not limited to fire, floods, embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war is declared or not), insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, acts of God or acts, omissions or delays in acting by any governmental authority; provided, however, that the party so affected shall use reasonable commercial efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance, and shall continue performance hereunder with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed.

The parties shall mutually seek a resolution of the delay or the failure to perform as noted above. <br /><br /><br /> 18. CONFIDENTIALITY <br /><br /> All confidential information disclosed by a party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is designated in writing as confidential ("Confidential Information") will be safeguarded by the Receiving Party to the same extent that the Receiving Party safeguards its own information of like kind, but using not less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement or disclose Confidential Information to any third party (except as explicitly stated in our Privacy Policy). The Receiving Party's obligations under this section shall not apply to information which is publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party, already in Receiving Party's possession without obligation of confidentiality, rightfully obtained by Receiving Party from third parties not under obligation of confidentiality, or independently developed by Receiving Party as evidenced by written documentation. If the Receiving Party is requested pursuant to a court or government order to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party will give the Disclosing Party written notice (if not legally prohibited from doing so) sufficient to enable the Disclosing Party to seek protective order and the Receiving Party will cooperate with the Disclosing Party in such effort. <br /><br /><br /> 19.
